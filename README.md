# Song Database Viewer

The Song Database is a program to show lyrics on a digital projector for worship in a congregation.
This app can display the data produced by [Song Database](https://codeberg.org/mathisdt/sdb2/) if it
is accessible via a URL (web address). It cannot be used for anything else, so if you don't use
Song Database, this probably isn't for you!

If you find a bug or want a new feature, you are welcome to
[file an issue](https://codeberg.org/mathisdt/sdbviewer/issues) or even fix things yourself
and create a pull request (see below).
Please don't try to communicate with me via reviews, that doesn't work in both directions.
You can also [write me an email](https://zephyrsoft.org/contact-about-me) and I'll see what I can do.
