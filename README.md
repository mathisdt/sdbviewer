# Song Database Viewer

The Song Database is a program to show lyrics on a digital projector for worship in a congregation.
This app can display the data produced by [Song Database](https://github.com/mathisdt/sdb2/) if it
is accessible via a URL (web address). It cannot be used for anything else, so if you don't use
Song Database, this probably isn't for you!
